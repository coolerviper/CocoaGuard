* Quick summary
- Overview
The app is designed to help underdeveloped regions reach out to their local agriculture department in order to determine whether or not their cocoa crop is diseased. This will be achieved through taking a picture of the crop and having the app send the picture to a local agriculture department for analysis. This way it will save the farmer a trip to the department in order to get an analysis. The other features will allow for the ability to see what kinds of pesticide/insecticides are recommended for the crop, details on how to apply fertilizer to the crop, a production cost estimator that will take into account numerous variables from the farmer to properly calculate the profit loss/gain, and finally a social media link so farmers can reach out and get in touch with us and the world.
